# Solidity-Smart-Contract

In this challenge I created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses are able to control a joint savings account. This smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

*My code is provided in "joint_savings.sol"*
